Connect to any [Sendspin](https://www.sendspin-audio.com) server and instantly turn your computer into an audio target that can participate in multi-room audio. Sendspin CLI includes both a TUI and a headless mode.

## Quick Start

**Run directly with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):**

Start client

```bash
uvx sendspin
```

Host a Sendspin party

```bash
uvx sendspin serve /path/to/media.mp3
```

## Installation

**With pip:**
```bash
pip install sendspin
```

**With uv:**
```bash
uv tool install sendspin
```

<details>
<summary>Install from source</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sendspin-Protocol/sendspin.git
cd sendspin
pip install .
```

</details>

**After installation, run:**
```bash
sendspin
```

The player will automatically connect to a Sendspin server on your local network and be available for playback.

## Configuration Options

### Server Connection

By default, the player automatically discovers Sendspin servers on your local network using mDNS. You can also connect directly to a specific server:

```bash
sendspin --url ws://192.168.1.100:8080/sendspin
```

**List available servers on the network:**
```bash
sendspin --list-servers
```

### Client Identification

If you want to run multiple players on the **same computer**, you can specify unique identifiers:

```bash
sendspin --id my-client-1 --name "Kitchen"
sendspin --id my-client-2 --name "Bedroom"
```

- `--id`: A unique identifier for this client (optional; defaults to `sendspin-<hostname>`, useful for running multiple instances on one computer)
- `--name`: A friendly name displayed on the server (optional; defaults to hostname)

### Audio Output Device Selection

By default, the player uses your system's default audio output device. You can list available devices or select a specific device:

**List available audio devices:**
```bash
sendspin --list-audio-devices
```

This displays all audio output devices with their IDs, channel configurations, and sample rates. The default device is marked.

**Select a specific audio device by index:**
```bash
sendspin --audio-device 2
```

**Or by name prefix:**
```bash
sendspin --audio-device "MacBook"
```

This is particularly useful for headless devices or when you want to route audio to a specific output.

### Adjusting Playback Delay

The player supports adjusting playback delay to compensate for audio hardware latency or achieve better synchronization across devices.

```bash
sendspin --static-delay-ms -100
```

> **Note:** Based on limited testing, the delay value is typically a negative number (e.g., `-100` or `-150`) to compensate for audio hardware buffering.

### Headless Mode

To run the player without the interactive terminal UI (useful for background services or scripts):

```bash
sendspin --headless
```

In headless mode, status messages are printed to stdout instead of the TUI.

### Debugging & Troubleshooting

If you experience synchronization issues or audio glitches, you can enable detailed logging to help diagnose the problem:

```bash
sendspin --log-level DEBUG
```

This provides detailed information about time synchronization. The output can be helpful when reporting issues.

## Limitations & Known Issues

This player is highly experimental and has several known limitations:

- **Format Support**: Currently fixed to uncompressed 44.1kHz 16-bit stereo PCM
- **Configuration Persistence**: Settings are not persistently stored; delay must be reconfigured on each restart using the `--static-delay-ms` option

## Sendspin Party

The Sendspin client includes a mode to enable hosting a Sendspin Party. This will start a Sendspin server playing a specified audio file or URL in a loop, allowing nearby Sendspin clients to connect and listen together. It also hosts a web interface for easy playing and sharing. Fire up that home or office 🔥

```bash
# Local file
sendspin serve /path/to/media.mp3
# Remote URL
sendspin serve https://retro.dancewave.online/retrodance.mp3
# Without pre-installing Sendspin
uvx sendspin serve /path/to/media.mp3
```
